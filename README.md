# CONFIGURABLE POMODORO TIMER
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/BIQ6nQXgjDk?si=q653P9d6aoVLwpXH
#### Description: This program utilizes the Pomodoro technique wherein rest is periodically done between periods of work. This program allows for the standard work and rest durations (25 minutes work and 5 minutes rest) while also allowing an option where the user can input their desired amount of work and rest.
#### Basic Instructions:
1. Make sure you are running Python version 3.9, this is because the playsound library does not support Python version 3.10 and beyond.

2. Install playsound version 1.2.2, specifically install this version of the library because later versions will generate error, some context: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68704443/python-playsound-error-261-for-command-the-driver-cannot-recognize-the-specifie

3. Make sure that you have used <cd path/to/pomodoro> in order to make sure alarm.mp3 and config.csv are accessible by the code

4. Follow the text prompts accurately. Even though I have done a lot of error checking, I still cannot assure that all errors are accounted for.

5. Enjoy!
